# Search Plugin for MCPi

**Search Plugin** has been adopted and redesigned to become all-in-one library 
search add-on for __Clue MCPi__, It allows to find items in video and music 
libraries and it is fully integrated in the global GUI (skin).
 
This plugin was design to run over ___Clue OS___ but it might work also 
on any Kodi version, over any _Debian_ operating system installed on RPi 
appliances.
